zip debug

v0.1 2018.1.2 WangZhou init

This doc helps to offer a use guide to test guys.
It includes: 1. how to compile zip driver; 2. how to run basic test case.


1. compile
----------

  a. WD

     For kernel driver: CRYPTO_DEV_HISI_ZIP should be set Y/M.

     For user space driver:

	now it is in kernel/samples/wrapdrive/*, which includes 2 parts, one is
	wrapdrive lib, another is test code in kernel/samples/wrapdrive/test/test_zip_smmu.c.

	So we should firstly compile wrapdrive lib:

	cd kernel/samples/wrapdrive
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make

	After this, wrapdrive libs will be compiled and put in samples/wrapdrive/.libs

	Then we compile test code:

	cd kernel/samples/wrapdrive/test
	gcc test_zip_iommu.c -static -L../.libs -lwd -luuid

	a.out will be static test binary, which can be run directly.

     note:

        1. I compile the user space driver in ARM64 machine.
	2. Maybe some auto building tools need be installed ahead.

2. test case
------------

  a. WD

     /* fix me */
     Now test_zip_iommu.c only supports zlib compress. We add a zlib compress
     head to compressed data, and write the data into a file named /root/compress_date
     in test_zip_iommu.c.

     So we can use zpipe software tool to decompress /root/compress_date to check
     if above zlib compress result is correct.
