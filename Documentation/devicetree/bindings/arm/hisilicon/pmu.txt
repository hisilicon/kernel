Hisilicon SoC HIP05 ARMv8 PMU

Required Properties:
	- compatible : This field contain two values. The first value is
		always "hisilicon" and second value is the PMU type as shown
		in below examples:
		(a) "hisilicon,hip05-llc" for Hisiliocn SoC L3 cache PMU
		(b) "hisilicon,hip05-ddrc" for Hisiliocn SoC DDRC PMU
		(c) "hisilicon,hip05-mn" for Hisiliocn SoC MN PMU

Optional Properties:

	- djtag	: Some PMU registers are accessed via the Djtag interface
		This field contains two values. The first value is the djtag
		node phandle and second value is the Super CPU Cluster ID.

	- interrupt-parent : A phandle indicating which interrupt controller
		this PMU signals interrupts to.

	- interrupts : Interrupt lines used by this PMU. If the PMU has
		multiple banks, then all IRQ lines are listed in this
		property.

Example:
	llc0: llc@0 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hip05-llc";
		djtag = <&djtag0 2>; /* DJTAG node for Super CPU Cluster 2
				      * (starts from 1) */
		interrupt-parent = <&mbigen_pc>;
		interrupts = <141 4>,<142 4>, 
			 <143 4>,<144 4>; /* IRQ lines for 4 L3 cache banks */
	};
