Hisilicon SoC HiP05/06/07 ARMv8 PMU
===================================

The Hisilicon SoC chips like HiP05/06/07 etc. consist of various independent
system device PMUs such as L3 cache (L3C) and Miscellaneous Nodes(MN). These
PMU devices are independent and have hardware logic to gather statistics and
performance information.

HiSilicon SoC chip is encapsulated by multiple CPU and IO dies. The CPU die
is called as Super CPU cluster (SCCL) which includes 16 cpu-cores. Every SCCL
in HiP05/06/07 chips are further grouped as CPU clusters (CCL) which includes
4 cpu-cores each.
e.g. In the case of HiP05/06/07, each SCCL has 1 L3 cache and 1 MN PMU device.
The L3 cache is further grouped as 4 L3 cache banks in a SCCL.

The Hisilicon SoC PMU DT node bindings for uncore PMU devices are as below.
For PMU devices like L3 cache. MN etc. which are accessed using the djtag,
the parent node will be the djtag node of the corresponding CPU die (SCCL).

L3 cache
---------
The L3 cache is dedicated for each SCCL. Each SCCL in HiP05/06/07 chips have 4
L3 cache banks. Each L3 cache bank have separate DT nodes.

Required properties:

	- compatible : This value should be as follows
		(a) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1" for v1 hw in HiP05/06 chips
		(b) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v2" for v2 hw in HiP07 chip

	- module-id : This property is a combination of two values in the below order.
		      a) Module ID: The module identifier for djtag.
		      b) Instance or Bank ID: This will identify the L3 cache bank
			 or instance.

Optional properties:

	- interrupt-parent : A phandle indicating which interrupt controller
		this PMU signals interrupts to.

	- interrupts : Interrupt lines used by this L3 cache bank.

	*The counter overflow IRQ is not supported in v1 hardware (HiP05/06).

Miscellaneous Node
------------------
The MN is dedicated for each SCCL and hence there are separate DT nodes for MN
for each SCCL.

Required properties:

	- compatible : This value should be as follows
		(a) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-mn-v1" for v1 hw in HiP05/06 chips
		(b) "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-mn-v2" for v2 hw in HiP07 chip

	- module-id : Module ID to input for djtag.

Optional properties:

	- interrupt-parent : A phandle indicating which interrupt controller
		this PMU signals interrupts to.

	- interrupts : Interrupt lines used by this PMU.

	*The counter overflow IRQ is not supported in v1 hardware (HiP05/06).

Example:

	djtag0: djtag@80010000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-djtag-v1";
		reg = <0x0 0x80010000 0x0 0x10000>;
		scl-id = <0x02>;

		pmul3c0 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1";
			module-id = <0x04 0x02>;
		};

		pmul3c1 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1";
			module-id = <0x04 0x04>;
		};

		pmul3c2 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1";
			module-id = <0x04 0x01>;
		};

		pmul3c3 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-l3c-v1";
			module-id = <0x04 0x08>;
		};

		pmumn0 {
			compatible = "hisilicon,hisi-pmu-mn-v1";
			module-id = <0x0b>;
		};
	};
